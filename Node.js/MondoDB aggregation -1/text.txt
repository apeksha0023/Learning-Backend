Two things 
1. Pipeline
2. stages

let x = 12
fun1 = sum(x)==>return x+5 ==> 17 --> y
fun2 = sub(y)==> return y-2 ==> 7 -->z
fun3 = mult(z)==> return z*15 ==>30 -->ans --> our desired output


 :- pipeline chaining multiple function and output of the prev function is input of next function and we are getting our desired result


 observation is : 
 how many functions i am using to get output --> 3 (stages in aggregation)

 mongodb agregation : visualising data , filtering , sorting , computing the data sum,sub,mul,div

 aggegation 
 {
    "name" : "Apeksha"
     "age" :  23
 }


 syntax :- 
 db.CN.aggregate([{filtering},{multiplication},{}])
 -> pipeline -->   [] 
 -> stages   -->   {}

NOTE :- All these oprations are going to be read only we are going to manupilate the data but not update the data in database
 stages :--
1. $match : it act like find() --> why not to use find() 
2. $project :
