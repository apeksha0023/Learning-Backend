create server
==> get request from client and i will send back response
==> client can request anytime ==> i have to continuosly listen to incoming request.



==> server its a process (system process) , i have to give port number.



problem : at every change rerunning the server
==> external module : store (npm)==> nodemon
==> node mon ==> node monitor ==> it will monitor the changes in the file

imp: "start backend project": npm init --y

Why Express.js??
==> Express is a backend web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js
==>  Fast , Unoinonated , Minimalist


Twi things in APIs :- 
==>endpoint like "/cart"
==>http verb like "GET,POST"

to taste ur APIs 
==> two tools
  ==> extension vs code : thunder cleint
  ==> we use Postman


  homework :
  update
  delete

  Restful APIs : HTTPS methods and they perform operations on resourses (CRUD)
                  they sends back the response in the form of JSON

 unopinionated : we can use as we want thats why it is called unopinionated.
