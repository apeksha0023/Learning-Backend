==>Types of middleware==> 3
==>inbuilt server.use(express.json())
==>custom middleware
==>external middleware

middleware covering the server both end


==>what should be in between client and the school endpoint
==>middleware(gatekeeper)

==>middleware will be function 

syntax - server.use(middleware_function_name)

server.get("/endpoint",[middleware1,middleware2],(req,res)=>{

})


2 ways of using middleware:
1-> globally serever.use(middleware_name1)   keep this at the top of api of url endpoint
2->using with endpoint
server.get("/endpoint",[middleware1,middleware2],(req,res)=>{
})


custom middleware ==> usecase
activity : log the information of each incoming request in a file calles req.txt

every request --> log it ?

activity 2 :->

I want to check the time taken from my api endpoint to send back the res of req
